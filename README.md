# cookiecutter-rainbowcake-screen
A cookiecutter template for generating a RainbowCake screen.

## Usage

Execute the following command in your *ui* package directory (e.g. ~/sources/myproject/app/src/main/java/com/example/**ui**)

`cookiecutter https://github.com/khongi/cookiecutter-rainbowcake-screen.git`

Currently does not support nested package hierarchy under the package root.

So the following is not yet supported:

~/sources/myproject/app/src/main/java/com/example/**somedir**/ui
